# RSS Feed Aggregator
We have a Django backend project for aggregating and managing RSS feeds. In this project, we write a parser for analyzing and selecting different RSS feeds from various sources, including APIs and custom XML feeds.
In costume parser, we are doing the below tasks:
+ Explore feed metadata, custom tags, and namespaces.
+ Implement advanced parsing techniques, including XML namespaces, and extract rich content.
